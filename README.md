# slot-scheduler

Chinese README: [README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md)

`slot-scheduler` is a small, repo-friendly experiment launcher for mixed compute fleets.

It is designed for the annoying real-world setup where some jobs should go through Slurm, some should go through plain SSH, and some can run locally. Instead of hard-coding all of that inside one project script, this repo keeps the resource inventory, backend logic, and queueing loop separate from your experiment code.

## Positioning

`slot-scheduler` is not trying to compete with full experiment platforms such as ClearML.

ClearML, SkyPilot, Ray-based platforms, and similar systems already do much more than this project:

- experiment tracking
- artifact and model management
- dashboards and web UIs
- pipelines and higher-level orchestration
- cluster- or cloud-level control planes

This project exists for the narrower case where those systems feel too heavy.

The goal here is:

- no server to deploy
- no database to manage
- no required SDK instrumentation in training code
- no assumption that all compute belongs to one cluster manager
- plain files, plain YAML, plain shell or Python commands

In other words, `slot-scheduler` is best thought of as a lightweight scheduling layer for messy real-world research compute, not as a full MLOps platform.

## What It Does

- Treats each runnable resource as a `slot`
- Supports `local`, `ssh + tmux`, and `slurm` backends
- Reads slots and jobs from YAML
- Launches one job per slot
- Polls running jobs and backfills open slots
- Writes a JSONL event log for inspection and post-processing
- Records per-job console logs and exit-code markers

## What It Does Not Do Yet

- No automatic rsync / code sync layer
- No DAG / dependency scheduling
- No autoscaling or utilization-aware packing
- No database; state is intentionally plain files

That is deliberate for the first version. The goal is a simple, hackable control plane that you can point at different repos.

## Use This When

`slot-scheduler` is a good fit if you want to:

- keep existing training scripts unchanged
- schedule plain shell or Python commands
- mix `local`, `ssh`, and `slurm` resources in one inventory
- run from inside a normal repo without deploying extra infrastructure
- keep state transparent and grep-friendly
- tweak scheduling behavior quickly in code

## Use Something Else When

You should probably use a heavier system if you need:

- experiment tracking, lineage, artifacts, and dashboards
- multi-user access control and tenancy
- managed cloud provisioning at scale
- autoscaling clusters and infrastructure optimization
- pipelines, workflow graphs, or production-grade orchestration
- a UI-first workflow for non-programmatic users

For those cases, tools such as ClearML, SkyPilot, Ray ecosystems, Dask, Runhouse, Ansible, or GNU Parallel may be a better starting point depending on the shape of the problem.

## Non-Goals

This repo is intentionally not trying to be:

- a ClearML replacement
- an experiment tracking system
- a workflow engine
- a cloud control plane
- a distributed runtime

The value proposition is narrower: make it easy to keep a small fleet of heterogeneous machines busy without forcing the rest of your stack to change.

## Config Format

Inventory:

```yaml
defaults:
  password_env: LEAP2_PASSWORD
  poll_seconds: 30

host_policies:
  - host: gpu2-001
    max_active_fraction: 0.5

slots:
  - name: gpu1-001
    backend: slurm
    host: gpu1-001
    node: gpu1-001
    gpu: 0
    partition: gpu1
    gres: gpu:1
    cpus_per_task: 48
    time_limit: 24:00:00
    workdir: /mmfs1/home/sqp17/Projects/VLMLP
    tags: [a100, leap2]

  - name: gpu2-001-g0
    backend: ssh
    host: gpu2-001
    gpu: 0
    provider: aws
    market: spot
    preemptible: true
    rebalance_signal: true
    workdir: /var/tmp/sqp17/code/VLMLP
    run_root: /var/tmp/sqp17/slot-scheduler/runs
    tags: [ssh, spillover]
```

`host_policies` are optional. If a host has no policy, `slot-scheduler` will greedily use all of its slots. If a policy is present, it caps how many slots from that host can be occupied at the same time.

Supported host policy fields:

- `max_active_slots`: hard cap for simultaneous slots on the host
- `max_active_fraction`: cap as a fraction of the host's declared slots

For example, a 2-GPU host with `max_active_fraction: 0.5` will only run one slot at a time.

Optional slot metadata for cloud-backed workers:

- `provider`: infrastructure source such as `aws`, `runpod`, `vast`, `tensordock`, or `salad`
- `market`: resource market such as `spot` or `on-demand`
- `preemptible`: whether the worker can be reclaimed by the provider
- `interruption_behavior`: provider-side interruption behavior metadata
- `rebalance_signal`: whether early rebalance signals are expected

These concepts are intentionally separate:

- `backend` answers how the job is launched, such as `ssh`, `slurm`, or `local`
- `provider` answers where the machine came from
- `market` answers what kind of capacity it is, such as `spot` or `on-demand`

A `provider` label does not create a new transport by itself. Marketplace-backed workers still need to be reachable through an existing backend such as `ssh`, `slurm`, or `local`.

SSH aliases from `~/.ssh/config` work too. That is often the cleanest way to use per-host keys:

```yaml
slots:
  - name: sun
    backend: ssh
    host: sun
    run_root: /home/sqp17/slot-scheduler/runs
    tags: [ssh, sshkey]
```

Jobs:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: smoke-a
    command: ["bash", "-lc", "hostname && sleep 5"]

  - name: only-on-slurm
    slots: [gpu1-001]
    command: ["bash", "-lc", "nvidia-smi && sleep 10"]

  - name: ssh-or-local
    backends: [ssh, local]
    retries: 1
    env:
      OMP_NUM_THREADS: "8"
    command: ["python", "-c", "print('hello from slot-scheduler')"]
```

Each job can optionally restrict itself with:

- `slots`: explicit slot names
- `backends`: allowed backend kinds
- `required_tags`: tags that must exist on the chosen slot
- `retries`: retry count after a non-zero exit code

## Usage

Create a run directory and launch:

```bash
uv run slot-scheduler run \
  --inventory examples/inventory.mixed.yaml \
  --jobs examples/jobs.demo.yaml \
  --run-dir .runs/demo
```

Show a compact summary later:

```bash
uv run slot-scheduler status --run-dir .runs/demo
```

Dry-run scheduling without launching:

```bash
uv run slot-scheduler run \
  --inventory examples/inventory.mixed.yaml \
  --jobs examples/jobs.demo.yaml \
  --run-dir .runs/demo \
  --dry-run
```

If your SSH hosts already use key-based login through `~/.ssh/config`, no password environment variable is required.

## SchedLang

`slot-scheduler` now includes an experimental DSL prototype for expressing scheduling intent at a higher level.

The goal is not to replace the current YAML runtime. Instead, the DSL acts as a front-end that compiles down to the existing `jobs.yaml`, and can optionally materialize host policies into a derived inventory file.

For a more systematic design sketch, see:

- [docs/schedlang-design.md](docs/schedlang-design.md)
- [docs/schedlang-design.zh-CN.md](docs/schedlang-design.zh-CN.md)

Today the DSL supports four main ideas:

- `pool`: reusable scheduling constraints such as `backends`, `required_tags`, or explicit `slots`
- `policy`: host-level limits such as `max_active_slots` or `max_active_fraction`
- `experiment`: a named experiment template
- `matrix`: cartesian expansion over experiment variables

The current compiler also understands assignment-style `requires { ... }` and `prefers { ... }` blocks.

- `requires` are hard constraints; the subset already understood by the runtime is still compiled into legacy `backends`, `required_tags`, and `slots` fields.
- `prefers` are soft constraints; they are preserved in the compiled YAML as structured metadata for future ranking and explainability work.
- host-level constraints such as `requires { host = "sun" }` are also preserved and enforced by the current runtime
- provider-level constraints such as `requires { provider = "runpod" }` are also preserved and enforced by the current runtime
- market-level constraints such as `requires { market = "spot"; preemptible = true }` are also preserved and enforced
- multi-GPU requirements such as `gpu_count = 4` are validated in the compile report, but still need a future multi-slot runtime

Example:

```text
pool txstate_ssh {
  requires {
    backends = ["ssh"]
    host_tags = ["txstate"]
  }
  prefers {
    placement = "spread"
    avoid_host_tags = ["shared"]
  }
}

policy shared_half {
  hosts = ["sun", "moon"]
  max_active_fraction = 0.5
}

experiment vlmlp_followup {
  use_pool = "txstate_ssh"
  matrix {
    dataset = ["ETTh2", "ETTm2"]
    pred_len = [96, 192, 336, 720]
    seed = [1, 2]
  }
  requires {
    gpu_count = 1
  }
  env {
    OMP_NUM_THREADS = "8"
    MKL_NUM_THREADS = "8"
  }
  retries = 1
  name_template = "vlmlp_${dataset}_pl${pred_len}_s${seed}"
  command = """
bash -lc "cd /home/sqp17/Projects/VLMLP && uv run python run_experiment.py ${dataset} ${pred_len} --seed ${seed}"
"""
}
```

Compile it into the current YAML runtime:

```bash
uv run slot-scheduler compile \
  --dsl examples/txstate_vlmlp.sched \
  --inventory-in examples/inventory.txstate-ssh.yaml \
  --inventory-out .runs/compiled-demo/inventory.yaml \
  --jobs-out .runs/compiled-demo/jobs.yaml \
  --report-out .runs/compiled-demo/report.yaml
```

Then run the scheduler exactly as before:

```bash
uv run slot-scheduler run \
  --inventory .runs/compiled-demo/inventory.yaml \
  --jobs .runs/compiled-demo/jobs.yaml \
  --run-dir .runs/txstate-vlmlp
```

Notes:

- the DSL is intentionally small and experimental
- strings and lists should currently use Python-style literals, for example `"ssh"` or `["sun", "moon"]`
- booleans accept both Python-style `True` / `False` and DSL-style `true` / `false`
- multiline shell commands work best with triple-quoted strings
- the compiled YAML remains the source of truth for the actual runtime behavior
- today the runtime directly enforces `backends`, `required_tags`, `slots`, and host filters from `requirements`
- provider filters from `requirements` are also enforced end-to-end
- `market` and `preemptible` filters are also enforced end-to-end
- `report.yaml` explains candidate slots and flags whether a job is `ready`, `unschedulable`, or currently `needs_multi_slot_runtime`

- [examples/inventory.marketplace-ssh.yaml](examples/inventory.marketplace-ssh.yaml)

## Watch Tool

This repo also ships a helper watch script for inventory-based GPU monitoring:

```bash
./scripts/watch_inventory --inventory examples/inventory.txstate-ssh.yaml --once
```

For continuously refreshing output:

```bash
./scripts/watch_inventory --inventory examples/inventory.txstate-ssh.yaml -n 2
```

If some inventory hosts still use password-based SSH, export a fallback password or prompt once:

```bash
export SLOT_SCHEDULER_WATCH_SSH_PASS='your-password'
./scripts/watch_inventory --inventory examples/inventory.leap2.yaml --once
```

or:

```bash
./scripts/watch_inventory --inventory examples/inventory.leap2.yaml --askpass --once
```

The watch tool:

- reads unique hosts from the inventory
- honors declared GPU indices when a host is split into per-GPU slots
- uses `run_root` or `workdir` to show the backing filesystem path
- shows Slurm node state and queued owners when local `sinfo` / `squeue` are available
- falls back to plain SSH probing when Slurm metadata is unavailable

## State Files

Every run writes:

- `state.jsonl`: event log
- `console/*.log`: local backend logs, plus the target log paths for SSH/Slurm jobs
- `status/*.exitcode`: exit-code marker files

The JSONL log is meant to be easy to grep, summarize, or feed into a dashboard later.

## Notes For VLMLP

This repo intentionally stops at generic job scheduling. Things like:

- selecting best strategies from old metrics
- building `run_experiment.py` commands
- copying repo files to remote hosts

belong in the experiment repo or in a thin adapter layer on top of `slot-scheduler`.
